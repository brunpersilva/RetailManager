 - Move the API to Azure
 - CI/CD process
 - Deploy the Desktop App to Blob Storage for download
 - Introduce a web-based inventory control system (Blazor?)
 - A Xamarin Form app for mobile register
 - Blazor app
 - Microservices

 3. CI/CD with Azure DevOps (Move sourse code to Azure DevOps?)
 4. Move the APi to Azure
 5. Move the database to Azure SQL
 6. Deploy the desktop app to Azure Blob storage
 7. Web-based inventory control system

 Phase 3 RoadMap
 1. Hook up inventory so it really increment/decrement
 2. Administrator portal (we-based)
 3. User Blazor WebAssembly PWA
 4. Dockerize backend (API, etc.)
 5. Break off a piece as a microservice
 6. Upgrade to .NET 5
